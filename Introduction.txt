due to the tremendous development of the world in industry, for instance, cars manufactures, There are a huge 
number of cars and trucks around the world, which resulting in a big number of collisions and fatalities.
so, The traffic accidents are consider a very big, common and important issue in each country around the world. 
So we are as a data scientists should find a solution for such a problem that reduce the collisions as much as possible.
In this project we will be working on a data set for the Seattle city to build a model who can predict 
the severity of the Accidents, based on some factors, for example, the weather, the road conditions and so on.
After building a model that results a good accuracy, we can use it as alert sign on the roads and highways to warn
the drivers and inform them about the possibilty of getting into an accident and its severity.
