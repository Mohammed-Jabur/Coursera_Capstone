In this capstone project we will be working on a data set to build a model who can predict 
the severity of the Accidents, based on some factors, for example, the weather, the road conditions and so on.
This data set has been collected from collisions and accidents in the Seattle city.


You can download the data set in CSV format from the following link:

https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv.
 
 
Let's open the CSV file and check what type of data we have. 
The first column is the labeled data. The remaining columns have different types of attributes. 
Some or all can be used to train the model, we will see which attributes to use in the code section.
 
The label for the data set is severity, which describes the fatality of an accident. 
You will notice that the shared data has unbalanced labels. You should balance the data, otherwise, 
you will create a biased ML model.
 
The following is a list of attributes or features a long with some description about each attribute:
